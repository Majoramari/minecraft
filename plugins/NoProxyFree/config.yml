#then this option will override that input.

#If the cache mode is ACCURATE, when the blacklist/whitelist cache is written to the respective file, the plugin will check
#to see if the IP is already in the file, and if not add it. This process will not completely override the file, however it will
#take much longer.

#manually (if this is the case use ACCURATE!)

#Cache refresh time in minutes, the recommended value is 10 minutes as having a time too short will result in more
